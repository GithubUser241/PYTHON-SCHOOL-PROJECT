# PYTHON-SCHOOL-PROJECT
python project to easily connect and use mysql from python

To use this you have to first install mysql-python connector
Then copy the below file in your module folder like C:\Users\USERNAME\anaconda3\Lib\site-packages who use jupyter notebook
else you have to make a empty file naming __init__.py 

This my first project therefore it is bit messy.
You can contribute to make code easy and faster.
